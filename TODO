Note that there won't be much new development on this version of Glade any
more. As soon as everything works for GTK+ 2 and GNOME 2, only bug fixes
will be allowed.

A rewrite of Glade (called Glade 3) is underway, and is in the glade3
module in the GNOME cvs repository.


Glade for GNOME 2
=================

 o i18n UTF-8 bug - filenames etc.

 o Update example app.

 o Documentation.


Minor bugs & notes
==================

 o Should add a Role property to windows at some point.

 o Grid/Snap settings should be in project options, so other developers use
   the same settings (What if different windows want different settings?).
   Move to Options dialog. Move 'Show Widget Tooltips' to View menu for now.
   Get rid of 'Settings' menu.

 o Should get rid of GtkCLists & other badly deprecated stuff.

 o Optional int properties - we currently use a checkbutton with no label, but
   it doesn't receive the input focus. Use a checkbutton with indicator off?
   with tick and cross icons? There is a GTK+ bug & patch about this issue.

 o Look for code that iterates over strings. need to use UTF8 functions.
   - project options stuff that creates options automatically.
   - widget name stuff?
   - signal handler name stuff in menu editor.
   - will only become a problem when non-ASCII used.

 o popup menus - make sure correct menu items are displayed - for widgets
   which can't be deleted/have event boxes added etc.

 o In GNOME version of Glade, if GNOME support is off, don't show the stock
   GNOME items (these have ids that start with 'gnome-stock').

 o buttons with label & icon. Bad interactions between label field in button
   and label, e.g. if you select the label and turn markup on, then select the
   button and enter bad markup.

   Either
    o Turn markup off when we set the label in the button.
    o Use common function to set the label from the button.
      But will this work for all buttons? in libglade?

 o radio groups - the widgets don't update well when you move them between
   groups, e.g. sometimes no widgets in the group are selected. I'm not sure
   if this matters.
