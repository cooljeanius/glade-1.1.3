Glade GTK+ 2 / GNOME 2 Beta Release Notes
=========================================

Glade is very nearly ready for a 2.0 release now. There have been very few
major bug reports for 1.1.2. If you spot any problems with this release,
please report them on bugzilla, http://bugzilla.gnome.org, under the 'Glade'
product.


I haven't updated this README for GTK+ 2 / GNOME 2 completely yet.
Basically if you have GTK+ 2 or GNOME 2 installed Glade should compile OK.

The code generators mentioned have probably not been updated to the new
file format yet, so you're stuck with Glade-generated C code or libglade
for now. (The DTD for the new format is included with libglade, by the way.)
C++ can now be generated by recent versions of glade--, though I'm not sure
if it has complete coverage of all widgets & properties.


Happy Bug-Hunting!

Damon



General Information
===================

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. It also contains
built-in support for generating the C source code needed to recreate the
interfaces.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in the well-known XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools. Several tools are already
available which can turn the XML files into source code in other languages
such as C++, Perl and Python. Other tools such as libglade can load the XML
files and create the interfaces at runtime (see the Languages Supported section
below).

Glade is primarily aimed at Linux and other Unix variants, though it can be
run on Win32 platforms (without the GNOME support). A port is included in the
Ada95 package (see the link below).


Glade Documentation
===================

A User Guide and FAQ are available from the 'Help' menu in Glade.
The User Guide is not finished yet.

See the 'TODO' file for current status & planned future developments.


License
=======

Glade is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), as described
in the COPYING file.

Note that you are free to use whatever license you like for the source code
generated by Glade. (We do not consider the code generated by Glade to be
'a work based on the Program' as described at the start of the GPL.)


Requirements
============

 o GTK+ 2.0.0 or above - http://www.gtk.org

 o GNOME 2.0.0 or above if you want GNOME support.

 o Automake 1.4 - ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake
                  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake
		  ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/
			(for i386 RPMs)
   This is needed to build the C source code generated by Glade.

 o Autoconf 2.52 - ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf
                   http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf
		   ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/
			(for i386 RPMs)
   This is needed to build the C source code generated by Glade.

 o Gettext 0.10.40 - ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gettext-0.10.40.tar.gz
   This is needed if you want to build applications with support for gettext.
   (Gettext provides support for translating the strings in your application
    into other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc.)

 o Scrollkeeper ??? - http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net
   This is a fairly new package for maintaining DocBook documentation on a
   system.


Languages Supported
===================

 o C - Glade outputs C code itself.
       The libglade library is also available. It creates the user interface
       dynamically by loading the XML files generated by Glade.
       See http://www.daa.com.au/~james/gnome/.

 o C++ (for the Gtk-- bindings) - http://home.wtal.de/petig/

 o Ada - support is included in the Ada GTK+ bindings: http://ada.eu.org/gtkada

 o Python support is included in the PyGTK bindings. See http://www.gtk.org
   A python source code generator is also being developed.
   See http://glc.sourceforge.net

 o Perl - http://freespace.virgin.net/dermot.musgrove/computers/perl/
       or http://www.glade.perl.connectfree.co.uk/index.html
       or on CPAN under the Glade module,
	 e.g. ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/CPAN/modules/by-module/Glade/

 o Eiffel - http://www.lfix.co.uk/eiflib/index.html#eglade


The Glade web site may contain more up-to-date links.

Please note that these packages are maintained independantly of Glade, and
so any bug reports should be sent to the appropriate package maintainer.


Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'


Mailing Lists
=============

There are three mailing lists related to Glade:

  glade-announce@ximian.com - A moderated list for announcements of new
			      versions of Glade and other closely-related
			      tools, such as libglade and the various code
			      generators.

  glade-users@ximian.com    - For discussions about using Glade to build
			      applications.

  glade-devel@ximian.com    - For discussions about the development of
			      Glade itself.

To subscribe, unsubscribe, or view the archives of the lists go to the
mailman web pages at:

  http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/glade-announce
  http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/glade-users
  http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/glade-devel


Alternatively you can use email to perform commands by mailing:

  glade-announce-request@ximian.com
  glade-users-request@ximian.com
  glade-devel-request@ximian.com

with commands such as 'subscribe' and 'help' in the subject line or
the message body.



How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug in Glade itself, go to http://bugzilla.gnome.org and fill out a
bug report, specifying 'glade' as the product.

Alternatively send mail to damon@gnome.org, or to the glade-users list
if you are subscribed.

(Please don't send bug reports about the external code generators.
They should be sent to the appropriate package maintainer.)

In the bug report include:

* The version of Glade.

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What version of GTK+.
   - If you are using the GNOME version of Glade, and if so which version
     of GNOME you are using.
   - What operating system and version.

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If you can, send a stack trace. To do that, start gdb with 'gdb glade',
  start glade with 'r', do whatever causes the crash, and then type 'bt' in
  the debugger to print a stack trace.


Submitting Patches
==================

Please use diff -ru to create the patch, and send it as an attachment
(gzipped if it is very large). If it entails major changes to Glade, please
discuss it on the glade-devel list first.
